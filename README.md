# hello-world
This is the first test project, meant to learn git

Hey there, my name is Michael! I'm an aspiring electrical engineering student looking to go into FPGA design and verification.
I also want to pursue an MBA after I get my BSEE which would allow me to go into project management and product development. 
I've enjoyed the opportunities that I've had to lead projects in the past through my experience in FIRST Robotics as a team lead and my time as president of the Everett Community College STEM Club.
I look forward to bringing my leadership and technical experience together in the field!
